Getting Started
To beging working on your own version of this project, download all of the files in this directory onto your computer. You must be sure that all files are placed in the same directory, or else references from one file to another may fail. Please modify all references to file locations within the downloaded files to match the location of the files on your own machine.

Prerequisites
Functioning Open Weather Map API Account: If you would like to deploy the live weather data feature of this project, you must make an account with the Open Weather Map API if you do not already have one. This will then allow you to generate an API Key for your project, which you can then use to query the API.
Google Firebase Account: You also must have an account with Google Firebase, or make one for this project. This will allow you to store users' blogposts in a database and display them on your site.
